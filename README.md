1. Description of topic content
The hair salon industry is changing, with a need for more efficiency and better
customer satisfaction. Traditional ways of booking appointments, managing
resources, and keeping up with customer relationships are often messy and full of
mistakes. Customers have a hard time finding appointments that fit their schedules,
and salon owners struggle with optimizing bookings and calculating salaries.
The proposed HairHarmony-On-Demand Hair Stylist Booking App aims to make
these processes easier. Customers can quickly book appointments and choose their
favorite stylists, while salon owners get a smooth appointment system, valuable
customer insights, and automated salary calculations, including commission based on
customer revenue to boost salon profits. The goal is to make things more convenient,
efficient, and enjoyable for everyone in the hair salon industry.
